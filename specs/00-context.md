# 0. Product Context

## High-Level Goal
Build a performance-focused Kanban application similar to Trello but optimized for speed and keyboard navigation.

## Core Rules
1. **No Backend (v1):** Use LocalStorage for persistence.
2. **Framework:** Next.js 14 + Tailwind.
3. **Strict Types:** All code must be strictly typed (TypeScript).

## User Personas
- **The Manager:** Needs to see the high-level status of tasks.
- **The Developer:** Needs to quickly move cards and add details without using a mouse (keyboard shortcuts).
